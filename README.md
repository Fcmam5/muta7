# Muta7

Accessibility impairment simulation extension

Muta7 is a Chromium browser extension that simulates real-world accessibility impairments so you can experience UX friction directly—beyond static audits. Perfect for developers, designers, and anyone who wants to understand how people with disabilities navigate the web.

## Features

- **Visual Impairment Simulation** (v0)
  - Adjustable blur intensity
  - Color blindness filters (Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, Monochromacy)
- **Website Scoping**
  - Enable only on specified websites
  - Support for origin and path-level rules
- **Developer-Friendly UI**
  - Instant toggle and intensity controls
  - Visual reminder when simulations are active
  - Extension badge shows active count
- **Privacy-First**
  - No analytics, no accounts, no backend
  - All state stored locally
  - Your data never leaves your browser
  - No tracking or user monitoring

## Installation

### From Source (Development)

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fcmam5/muta7.git
cd muta7
```

2. Load in Chromium
- Open `chrome://extensions`
- Enable "Developer mode"
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Select the `muta7` directory

### From Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

*Will be available once published.*

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Open any website
2. Click the Muta7 extension icon
3. Click "Enable for current website" or add URL rules
4. Toggle "Blur simulation" and adjust intensity
5. Refresh if prompted after changing website scope

### Website Scoping

By default, Muta7 works only on websites you specify:

- **Enable for current website** — Adds the current site origin
- **Enable for URLs** — Add multiple rules (one per line)
  - Supports bare domains: `example.com`
  - Supports full URLs: `https://example.com/app`
  - Origin rules match entire site
  - Path rules match that path and deeper

### Controls

- **Blur simulation** — Toggle on/off
- **Intensity** — Slider from 0–100
- **Color blindness filter** — Toggle on/off with selectable modes
- **Reminder banner** — Shows when any simulation is active
- **Extension badge** — Shows active simulation count

## What This Is Not

**Muta7 is not an accessibility reporting or checklist tool.**

For comprehensive accessibility testing and compliance, use dedicated tools maintained by experts:
- [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)
- [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [W3C Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/)

Muta7 complements these tools by letting you *feel* accessibility issues, not just detect them.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
- No external dependencies required

### Project Structure

│       └── popup.js
├── manifest.json           # Manifest V3
└── README.md
```

### Adding a New Simulation Module

1. Create module file in `src/modules/[category]/[name].js`
2. Expose `enable(config)`, `disable()`, `update(config)`
3. Load in `manifest.json` content_scripts
4. Add UI controls in popup
5. Wire state in background service worker

### Code Style

- Use modern JavaScript (ES modules)
- Keep modules independent and reversible
- Prefer CSS filters for visual effects
- Separate UI, state, and DOM logic
